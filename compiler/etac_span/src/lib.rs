//! Source positions and the source map.
//!
//! All loaded files share one global byte-offset space: each file is assigned a
//! `base` and occupies `[base, base + len)`, with a one-byte gap between files.
//! A [`Span`] is therefore just two offsets into that space — 8 bytes, `Copy`,
//! and file-agnostic. The owning file is recovered on demand via
//! [`SourceCache::file_for`], so individual AST nodes never carry a [`FileId`].
//!
//! The space is addressed with `u32`, capping total loaded source at 4 GiB.
//!
//! The cache is append-only: files are inserted into an [`elsa::sync::FrozenMap`]
//! and never mutated or removed, so [`SourceCache::load`] can hand out `&str`
//! borrows tied to `&self` while later loads keep appending. Crucially,
//! [`SourceCache`] carries **no lifetime parameter** — borrowers (the lexer,
//! [`DiagCtxt`], ASTs) all borrow *from* the cache with their own ordinary
//! lifetimes, rather than the cache borrowing from itself.
//!
//! Both the path table behind [`FileId`] and the [`SourceCache`] are `Sync`:
//! ids and spans minted on one thread mean the same thing on every other, so
//! parallel per-file frontends can share one cache when the driver grows them.
//!
//! The canonical cache is the process-global [`SOURCES`]. Because the map is
//! append-only *and* the owner lives for the whole process, text borrows from
//! it are `&'static str` — which is what lets [`DiagCtxt`], the lexer, tokens,
//! and the parsers exist without a `'src` lifetime parameter.
